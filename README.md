# Quizzical App Solo Project Scrimba

This Markdown file provides an overview of the Quizzical app project developed as the final course project. The project focuses on creating an app that generates quizzes.

## Project Overview

The Quizzical app is designed to generate quizzes dynamically. Users can interact with the app to answer questions and receive feedback on their performance.

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following technologies and concepts:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Functional Components**: Components written as functions, which are a key feature of React.
- **JavaScript Object and Array Functions**: Leveraging JavaScript's object and array functions for data manipulation and management.
- **useState Hook**: A React hook used to add state to functional components, enabling them to manage and update their own state.
- **useEffect Hook**: A React hook used for side effects in functional components, such as fetching data or subscribing to external events.
- **Figma**: A collaborative interface design tool used for designing the frontend of the app. The frontend design is based on the provided Figma design.

## Project Structure

The project is likely structured as follows:

- **Components**: Functional components for different parts of the application, such as quiz questions, answers, and feedback.
- **State Management**: Utilizes the useState hook for managing component state, which includes storing quiz data, user answers, and feedback.
- **Effectful Logic**: Utilizes the useEffect hook for performing side effects, such as fetching quiz data from an API or updating the UI based on user interactions.
- **Styling**: Frontend styling based on the provided Figma design, likely implemented using CSS or CSS-in-JS.
